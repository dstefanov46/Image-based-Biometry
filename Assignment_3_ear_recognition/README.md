## Image-based Biometry
## Assignment 3: Ear Recognition Development

## Environment setup

- The notebook was run on a Windows 10 platform.
- The distribution which was used during the development of this assignment is the **Anaconda distribution**
of Python.
- The whole ear recognition process was written into one notebook **ear_recognition.ipynb**.  
- In order to set up the environment in which the **ear_recognition.ipynb** notebook was developed, you need to create 
  an environment from the **ibb_environment.yml** file that has also been added to the repo.  
- The **ibb_environment.yml** file contains all the packages needed to run the **ear_recognition.ipynb** notebook, so no
additional installations are needed.
