## Image-based Biometry
## Assignment 2: Ear Detection

## Environment setup

- The distribution which was used during the development of this assignment is the **Anaconda distribution**
of Python.
- So, in order to set up the environment in which the **IoU_testing.ipynb** notebook (this is the notebook where
all the testing of the detectors was done) was developed, you need to create an environment from the 
**ibb_environment.yml** file that has also been added to the repo.  
- The **ibb_environment.yml** file contains all the packages needed to run the **IoU_testing.ipynb** notebook, so no
additional installations are needed.
