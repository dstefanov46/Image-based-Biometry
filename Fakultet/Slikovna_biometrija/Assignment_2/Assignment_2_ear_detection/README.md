# Image-based Biometry
## Assignment 2: Ear Detection

## Environment setup

- The distribution which was used during the development of this assignment is the **Anaconda distribution**
of Python.
- So, in order to set up the environment in which the **IoU_testing.ipynb** notebook was developed, you 
need to create an environment from the **ibb_environment.yml** file that has also been added to the repo.
- The **ibb_environment.yml** file contains all the packages needed to run the **IoU_testing.ipynb** notebook, so no
additional installations are needed.
