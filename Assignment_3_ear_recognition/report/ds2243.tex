\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a deep learning model for ear image recognition developed for the purpose of completing Assignment \#3 in the subject Image-based Biometry. The model builds upon on the already existing convolutional neural network (later in the paper referred to as CNN) VGG16 researched as part of [1]. This neural network has been extensively tested and has achieved satisfactory results, hence our decision to utilize it in our recognition problem as well. 
And, in spite of the fact that the dataset we used contains images which are rather difficult to classify (additional information on this remark can be found in [2]), we managed to achieve accuracy of 91 \% on the test set.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
To begin with, we would like to provide a brief description of the dataset used for this recognition task. It consists of 1000 cropped ear images of 100 subjects collected via various sources on the Internet. This data collection named AWE Dataset which can be obtained at [3] was also the test dataset for the First Unconstrained Ear Recognition Challenge (UERC) in 2017, and as such can be considered a representative test of a model's quality. On this set of images, aside from the standard classification of persons to whom the images belong, ethnicity and gender can be analyzed as well. This functionality is available owing to the annotation files, coming along with the images, which contain these two pieces of information about the subjects. Therefore, we opted to create a model for binary classification - males and females.

\section{Methodology}
VGG16 is a CNN that takes advantage of convolution layers of 3x3 filter and maxpool layer of 2x2 filter. This arrangement of convolution and max pool layers remains consistent throughout the whole architecture. At the end, there are 2 fully connected layers followed by a softmax layer for the output. And, this last layer is the segment of the neural network we modified for the purposes of our classification. The implementation of VGG16 in Keras, the library we made use of, in its final layer classifies into a 1000 classes by default. However, the number of classes in our problem is 2, so we replaced the softmax layer with another dense layer classifying into 2 different classes.

In the machine learning community, it has been well documented that for this type of classification problems a 5-fold or 10-fold cross-validation of the model suffices to show its robustness. Also, in the AWE Toolbox a 5-fold cross-validation is performed, so we followed this procedure. In addition, we split the AWE Dataset into 70 \% training data and 30 \% test data, and judging by the performance of our model which will be discussed in the following sections of the paper, we believe the correct choice was made.

\section{Results}
As we have already mentioned in the previous section, the results after the cross-validation of our model were rather satisfactory. A more detailed representation of them can be found in the following Table 1:

\begin{table}[h!]
\caption{Summarization of the 5-fold cross-validation performed on our model through the computation of the metrics: accuracy and AUC (Area Under the Curve).}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{llll}
\hline
                  & validation accuracy & validation AUC    \\
\hline
fold \#1              & 0.95000   & 0.95060  \\
\hline
fold \#2             & 0.90000     & 0.90071 \\
\hline
fold \#3             & 0.95000   & 0.95071 \\
\hline
fold \#4            & 0.83571  & 0.83600 \\
\hline
fold \#5           & 0.91429   & 0.91367  \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Table 1 shows that the validation accuracy of our model was in all cases except for the fourth fold above 90 \%. This kind of percentages can be considered acceptable, but the value we should look more carefully at, is the validation Area Under the Curve (AUC). As we can observe, the validation AUC is in the rank from 0.9 to 1.0 for most iterations. Such scores mean that our neural network completes the classification task excellently.

Lastly, we would like to mention the accuracy our model achieved on the test set. It was 91 \%, again a satisfactory value, which comes as no surprise bearing in mind the scores received during the cross-validation.

\section{Conclusion}
All in all, it can be said that our fine-tuning of the VGG16 neural network turned out to be adequate for the binary classification task we chose to tackle. The modified CNN provided promising results during the validation process, and further proved them during the testing stage.
